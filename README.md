# Cipher's Courtier Expansion v1.5 - Maintained by Countern

The original mod is created by "Magickarp" Cipher and can be [found here](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1878436818)

So far, this mod is not yet ready to be released on Steam Workshop and other mod hosting websites since I still need to patch some stuff up. 

As of 2022-7-12, I will be patching up Cipher's Courtier Expansion mod to fix any errors and obsolete/deprecated codes.
Starting from 2022-7-20, I will be maintaining Cipher's Courtier Expansion mod while at the same time making adding my own expansion in another branch (sometime later).

## Installation Instructions

1. Click on the green `Clone` button located at the top right of the listed files
   * A drop menu should pop up
2. Click on `Download ZIP` to download the mod
   * Located at the bottom of the drop menu
3. Extract the content in the ZIP archive file to your Crusader Kings II `mods` folder (should be located somewhere in your Documents folder for Windows)

4. Open the `cipher-courtier-expansion-maintenance` folder
5. Move the `cipher-courtier-expansion-maintenance.mod` file into the `mods` folder where all the other `.mod` files are located
