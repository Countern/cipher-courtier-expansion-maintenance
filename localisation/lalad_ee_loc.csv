EVTDESClalad_ee_events.0;One night an unusual storm presses in on the area. In the distance black clouds begin to swirl, the wind tears like blades and the rain stings your skin. It's a tornado!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAlalad_ee_events.0;Hmm, I wonder...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBlalad_ee_events.0;RUN!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESClalad_ee_events.1;You ran but something nags at the back of your mind, oh well atleast you are alive.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAlalad_ee_events.1;That's a relief.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESClalad_ee_events.2;By some miracle you are alive, after being knocked unconscious by debris, you awake in a strange land. Looking about everything glows with yellow, even the road.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAlalad_ee_events.2;Guess I should look around.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESClalad_ee_events.3;You stumble onto a village. Wandering about the square, you notice the populace are all dwarves, and they sing. So you decide to run but what path do you take?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAlalad_ee_events.3;The Yellow one.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBlalad_ee_events.3;The Less Yellow one;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESClalad_ee_events.4;You followed the path for weeks, along the way you met several strange people, but that's behind you, you've made it to a Green Shack, as you approach the door it opens, an old man appears in a funny hat. Before you can react the old man whacks you in the head with a club. The world shuts off.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAlalad_ee_events.4;That hurt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESClalad_ee_events.5;You wake to screams, your council surrounds you, it seems you fell unconscious and smacked your head on the court floor. Was it a dream?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAlalad_ee_events.5; You were there, and you were there, and you...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBlalad_ee_events.5;Better keep it to myself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESClalad_ee_events.6;You rushed off into a tornado, what in the world possessed you to do that, did you expect a magical adventure or something?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAlalad_ee_events.6;Goodbye.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESClalad_ee_events.10;You rushed out of town without thinking, soon lost your bearings and were forced to return to the dwarf kin village and start over.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAlalad_ee_events.10;HELP!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
