EVTDEScourt_prom.1;One day whilst you are working, your employer excitedly approaches you. "Your performance has been outstanding [Root.GetDynName]! We have been hearing very good things about you, and I've decided to increase your salary. Have a small bonus on me.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAcourt_prom.1;I have outdone myself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESliegecap_events.1;During your visit to [capitalcity.GetName], you bump into your liege during a stroll around the capital. To your surprise, he seems to be accompanied by his entire entourage. This could prove to be a useful moment to improve your position in court.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTAliegecap_events.2;So it seems.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESliegecap_events.3;Strolling through the alleys of [capitalcity.GetName], you notice something peculiar... it seems that a lady dressed in silk is following you. You turn to confront her, and she calmly explains how she travelled from far away with her husband. She has seen you around the town and claims to see in you a kindred spirit, saying she wants to teach you about the values she thinks you share.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAliegecap_events.3;Maybe these values are what was missing in my faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBliegecap_events.3;A tempting offer, but let me talk about values to you instead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCliegecap_events.3;These are good values.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDliegecap_events.3;I am already a just [GetManWoman], your values mean nothing to me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESliegecap_events.4;While walking through an alley, you are suddenly confronted with a violent duel between what seem to be two mortal enemies. They seem so obsessed on killing each other that they don't notice you, and their slashing sabres are getting ever closer...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAliegecap_events.4;I'll end them both right here!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBliegecap_events.4;If I try hard enough I might just get away...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESliegecap_events.102;It took quite a while to pack all the necessities for such a long journey, and after preparation you decide to head to your liege's capital due the great things you have heard about it! Your liege has even offered you a place in their castle, even if they did not guarantee you'd have a chance to meet them during you stay.

EVTDESliegecap_events.6;Walking by an inn, you are made suddenly aware of the rumbling of your empty belly after a long days travel. As you enter it, you notice it is very crowded and, after a while, you realise why. The meals they serve here are extraordinary. The meat is cooked to perfection and the mead seems like it was made by [GetRandomGodName]. As you settle down and work your way through the sumptous meal, you appreciate the good things in life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESrecruit_event.1; All know that in this world, one must be surrounded by loyal men to survive. However, men do not come without a monetary incentive.

EVTTITforesthunting_events.102;The Hunting Expedition;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESforesthunting_events.102;A hunt is a fine way to improve ones strength or to get ones blood up with a good, honest kill. After some preparation, [Root.GetDynName] is ready to head out with the rest of the expedition led by [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName]. Excitement is high among all members of the party, as the dogs charge ahead and horns thunder behind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAforesthunting_events.102;I'll hunt the biggest beast!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESforesthunting_events.1;Your small splintered off hunting party was excitedly chasing a deer, when out of nowhere a band of brigands and bandits materialise from the surrounding forest.

EVTDESforesthunting_events.2;As the hunt progresses, you find youself spending more and more time with a particularly brilliant hunter.

It seems he has decided to place his future in your hands, seing great promise in your skill and wit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAforesthunting_events.2;I would never refuse such loyalty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBforesthunting_events.2;I really dont think I'm the man you're looking for.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESforesthunting_events.4;"Am I going mad?" /h You find yourself alone the woods and out of the corner of your eye, but never quite in focus, you think you see a pale lady in a white dress looking at you. She seems so sad, so lonely. As you try to escape, running blindly through the forest, you feel like you can hear a haunting melody on the wind which stops abruptly as you stumble back upon the party. None of your fellow hunters seem to have notice her presence, nor your absence... did any of that even happen?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAforesthunting_events.4;There's no way I saw a ghost....;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTAforesthunting_events.5;I will do good by these great men!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESforesthunting_events.6;While chasing a beastly looking rabbit, you notice your fellow hunter take a wrong turn and, in an instant, the poor man is now hanging for his life, holding onto a branch as he dangles over a concealed overhang.

EVTDESmoving_events.1;As you step up to the new court, unprepared and nervous at the new life you are to start here, you notice the looks on those around you. The other courtiers seem to be whispering and staring with much interest. It seems as if they knew you were coming. Worried, you pass the halls towards the throne room but to your surprise your new liege seems to be smiling and beckoning you in. "[Root.GetDynName], it took you longer than I expected! I was warned by your previous liege that you'd be arriving. It seems you are interested in serving me?" As you nod, they continue, "Of course I am willing to take you in. I hope you feel welcome and I hope your services will be appreciated here.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmoving_events.1;What a pleasant surprise!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTITLEmoving_events.2;The Court of [newLiege.GetTitledFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESmoving_events.2;You step into the throne room of your new liege, take a deep breath, and bow to [newLiege.GetTitledFirstName] as you offer your services.

I do not feel you are truly invested in serving me. I will require you to prove to me that you are indeed loyal to my House, and most importantly, to me!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTITLEmoving_events.3;The Court of [newLiege.GetTitledFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESmoving_events.3;After a long and arduous journey, this is not the welcome you expected. The gates to the throne room of your would-be liege had been barred for you. As you attempt to find another entrance, a guards behind you snickers and informs you that you aren't wanted anywhere within 10 leagues of here... This truly was a disastrous journey , you think, as you make your way back to your old liege and hope they feel generous when you explain your situation...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTITLEmoving_events.6;Religious Journey;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESmoving_events.6;The journey has tested your faith like nothing else. \n On a dark and stormy evening, you bump into a hermit on the road.
