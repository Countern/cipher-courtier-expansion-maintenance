# Maintainer's Notes

1. `/common/job_actions/landless_job_actions.txt`
   I do not know where the "aspiring_business_owner" modifier comes from, so
   I'm just gonna leave it there for now...
   But I did change the old character modifier condition to the new one.
2. This mod's `start_cadet_branch` decision overlapping with CK2Plus' `start_cadet_branch` decision
3. Localisation files to take note of:
   * `lalad_loc.csv` - **EVTDESChomeless_event.1** - Weird "ou'"
   * `ciphers_courtier_loc.csv` - **EVTDESmoving_events.5** - Unknown character after "ruler"
   * `troubles_courtier_loc.csv` - **EVTDESCtroublesevents.3** - The [GetName] in [Liege.GetName] is only for titles, not characters
4. Decisions to take note of:
   * `00_LALAD_decisions.txt` - **quit_job** - Decision not removing job traits and character flags after quitting
   * `00_LALAD_decisions.txt` - **move_court_to** - Players being able to move to their own liege's court
   * `Courtier_troubles_decisions.txt` - **solve_trouble** - Immediate_Revolt province modifier still active once a rebellion start
      * Might add an on_action instance to solve the problem above
5. Events to take note of:
   * `courtier_visit_liege_capitals_events.txt` - **liegecap_events.6** - Description text too long, might convert to long_character_event or narrative_event
6. Minor titles files to take note of:
   * `courtier_title.txt` - **title_courtier** - A lot of missing code for a minor title instance

   * Only tied to action_manage_business instance in `/common/job_actions/`
