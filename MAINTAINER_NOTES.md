# Maintainer's Notes

1. `/common/job_actions/landless_job_actions.txt`
   I do not know where the "aspiring_business_owner" modifier comes from, so
   I'm just gonna leave it there for now...
   But I did change the old character modifier condition to the new one.
2. This mod's `start_cadet_branch` decision overlapping with CK2Plus' `start_cadet_branch` decision
3. Localisation files to take note of:
   * ~~`lalad_loc.csv` - **EVTDESChomeless_event.1** - Weird "ou'"~~
   * ~~`ciphers_courtier_loc.csv` - **EVTDESmoving_events.5** - Unknown character after "ruler"~~
   * ~~`troubles_courtier_loc.csv` - **EVTDESCtroublesevents.3** - The [GetName] in [Liege.GetName] is only for titles, not characters~~
   * ~~`N/A` - **EVTDESrecruit_event.8 .7 .6** - Localisation key does not key, key refers to recruiting army 250 edition~~
4. Decisions to take note of:
   * `00_LALAD_decisions.txt` - **quit_job** - Decision not removing job traits and character flags after quitting
   * `00_LALAD_decisions.txt` - **move_court_to** - Players being able to move to their own liege's court
      * Might add another decision to pay homage or swear an oath to player's current liege as a courtier
   * `Courtier_troubles_decisions.txt` - **solve_trouble** - Immediate_Revolt province modifier still active once a rebellion start
      * Might add an on_action instance to solve the problem above
5. Events to take note of:
   * ~~`courtier_visit_liege_capitals_events.txt` - **liegecap_events.6** - Description text too long, might convert to long_character_event or narrative_event~~
   * ~~`courtier_wars_events.txt` - **courtierwar_events.3** - No need for AI ruler to have an option that rewards the player martial courtier, just reference the player courtier themselves in an immediate block~~
6. Minor titles files to take note of:
   * `courtier_title.txt` - **title_courtier** - A lot of missing code for a minor title instance
7. Others:
   * When a ruler overthrows the player's liege (if playing as courtier), the Courtier minor title is lost
   * Missing jobs for: Stewardship and Intrigue

## Notes on missing stuff that's part of the mod

* Missing localisation keys for **trader_events.2** event
   * I am stumped on how I should proceed with filling in the missing localisation since I don't know what's going on in the event
   * I'm going to leave it empty for now until I fully know what's happening in the event (or if someone else does)
* Something about "aspiring_business_owner" char modifier
   * Missing modifier
   * Only tied to action_manage_business instance in `/common/job_actions/`
* Something about "constructing_courtier" char/title flag
* ~~Something about "mod_quarry_knowledge" char modifier~~
   * ~~Missing modifier~~
   * ~~Tied to quarry events~~
