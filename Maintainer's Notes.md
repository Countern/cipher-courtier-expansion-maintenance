## To Do

1. `/common/job_actions/landless_job_actions.txt`
   I do not know where the "aspiring_business_owner" modifier comes from, so
   I'm just gonna leave it there for now...
   But I did change the old character modifier condition to the new one.
2. This mod's `start_cadet_branch` decision overlapping with CK2Plus' `start_cadet_branch` decision
	
Notes on missing stuff that's part of the mod:
   * Something about "constructing_courtier" char/title flag
   * Something about "mod_quarry_knowledge" char modifier
